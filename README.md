### Working, but unstyled tetris game build with vanilla JS and the Canvas API.

Built some while ago without any preceding preparation (e.g. watching/reading tutorials) to test my JS skills. Might not yet look good, but it's working and all edge cases (like specific collisions when rotating) are accounted for.
